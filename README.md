# Surfs_up

## Overview of the statistical analysis:
In this analysis we are to find more information about temperature trends before opening a surf shop and an ice cream shop. We are to specifically find the temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu.


### Results:
  - In this analysis I have found that the average temperature for June is 74.94 with a minimum temperature of 64 and a maximum temperature of 85.

  - The result we see with these datapoints are that the major differences are the count amount and the minimum.


## Summary:

What we can summerize about this analysis is that for this market the biggest change would be during the winter as some may be less willing to go surfing or eat ice cream in weather that is below 60 degrees. For a better analysis you can perform two other queries such as the precipitation stats for both June and December. If you can see there is also a lot more precipitation during the winter so also less ideal for a thriving surfing environment and same would go for the ice cream shop.

I do think an even better analysis would be to look at the entire year and determine would this be a good decision considering a lot more can happen beyond two months.
